== README

To do:
- for bankaccount move to a skin controller fat model design
- enhance testing
- deploy latest version on Heroku
- test live within close circle
- connection to Heroku database ideally through psql (rails console not enough)
- reinforce authorization especially make sure that some users profile cannot access other resources make sure this is tested
- issue if passwords do not match - application says does not in english and not in French
- admin (and probably other view) when I do show on bank resources navbar vanishes
- admin missing links to add a contact bank
- after adding an account should be redirected to the list of account - not the random test page
- When a client logs in but he has already logged in error is email address already taken instead of "you are already registered"
- Somehow it says that it is not pre-authentified which does not seem to be true
- Welcome screen of client not centered as it should be (go on right)
- When you click on account (sign) same for the rest the classification changes and the account go at the bottom some how
- Creation of bankcontacts is not clear - what should we do when the bankcontact is created what the user should do?
- Issue look at Bruno - do not see all bankaccounts he should see especially those that are done - double check the query
